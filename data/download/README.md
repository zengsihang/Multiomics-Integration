Each directory contains a README file with necessary information for data download.

Some directories also contain a preprocessing script (`preprocess.sh`) that performs initial preprocessing of the downloaded files.

All data files must be downloaded and preprocessed as specified in README and `preprocess.sh` before proceeding with the data collection pipeline.
